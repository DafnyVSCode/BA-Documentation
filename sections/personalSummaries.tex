The work on this project has been a very existing and informative experience. While having previously worked on IDE plugins, it was something entirely different integrating an entire language, especially one that is specification constructs driven, something which I also was not very experienced in. \newline

Our project plan was pretty ambitious, while having not experience in proof theory we wanted to integrate a generic way to propose specification. While this task would be very interesting, it soon became apparent that it was not feasible with our knowledge in proof theory and the project scope. Additionally, existing literature suggests that this problem is almost unsolvable hard anyway when working with the kind of proof engine that the Dafny pipeline uses. However, it was very interesting to gain a working knowledge in this area. \newline

After the above mentioned problem was discovered, we reduced our ambitions to provide solutions to concrete problems, which we discovered emerge quite often during problems. It was interesting to isolate situations that programmers could be helped with while it still had to be feasible to provide this help. At the end of this project, I am quite content with the Dafny specific features that we were able to implement, ranging from automatic null checking up unto providing decrease guards. This relieves the programmer of much tedious, but important work. \newline

Farhad Metha was always quick to break down problems to understandable point of abstraction when we got stuck somewhere and also provided many important suggestions and ideas throughout our work. This made us progress smoothly while still leaving us room to try to tackle problems we deemed difficult. It is safe to say our plugin would not be as coherent as it is now would it not have been for the iterative feedback loop that adviser provided very professionally \newline

Next to implementing Dafny specific features, we also implemented all the important IDE agnostic features one expects from a language integration. This was interesting to do and further deepened my knowledge about typescript. The plugin also raised questions about efficiency, correct scoping, caching and the correct architecture which I haven't encountered in this way before and I am proud of the way we resolved them in our product. The implementation of the language server protocol also made our plugin mostly IDE agnostic, something which I also found pretty cool. \newline 

Having already worked on previous projects with Markus, I knew that our collaboration would run smoothly as ever while being very efficient and fruitful. Providing each other with feedback consistently throughout the project helped it reach the quality is has now. Having a similar working speed, we were able to reach our goals and finish the project on time. I would be delighted if all my further collaborations could be held to this standard. \newline

Because we applied the concept of continuous delivery, the plugin already is used by several people around the globe, giving it at least some creditability regarding stability and helpfulness. The documentation and the open source nature of the project invite other people to continue the work on this project and I am happy when it is of use to the Dafny community.
