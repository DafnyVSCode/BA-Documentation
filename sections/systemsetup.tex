\subsection{Continuous Integration}

To ensure that the code quality is high and the code is working as expected, all commits trigger automatically builds of the respective project. A commit to the documentation repository, executes a job which automatically creates a pdf out of the latex source. This document is then copied to the wwwroot directory, which then could be downloaded from the project homepage. Commits to the vscode-dafny repository will result in build and afterwards in a complete run of all tests on the three environments. Therefore on Ubuntu and OSX remote agents are installed, which tests the plugin on this operation system.  Additionally SonarQube is used to find bugs and bad pratices as early as possible. The last repository which triggers bamboo jobs is the project homepage. The latest version is built and deployed when a commit happens.
