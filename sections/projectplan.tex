\subsection{Project Plan}\label{projectplan}
This project plan was the result of the original planning of the project. It put milestones, features and artifacts into a desired chronological order. Some deviations of this plan had to be done during the project because of new insight was gained while working on implementing the plugin. These deviations are detailed in \ref{projectCourse}.
