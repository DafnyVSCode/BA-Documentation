\subsection{Test specification}

\subsubsection{Unit Tests}
Visual Studio Code plugins can be tested with standard javascript testing frameworks like Mocha or Jasmine, if they don't use any features of Visual Studio Code itself. This allows to test core logic without the need to run tests inside VS Code.


\subsubsection{Integration Tests}
VS Code extensions which require VS Code API can be tested with help of a special instance of VS Code. Inside this instance, the extension can use the full API and tests can execute commands like creating a new file, entering a character, using auto-completion and verifing if the extension works as expected. Therefore
