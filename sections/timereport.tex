\subsection{Time report}
This chapter gives insight into how the time was invested that was spent while working on this project. First, an overview is given, which puts the different categories of work into contrast to each other. The second chart shows the progression of total work done over time. As can be seen, the total work done is well in the margin of 5\% around the desired time of 720 hours which is suggested when writing a bachelor thesis when working in a team of two.
