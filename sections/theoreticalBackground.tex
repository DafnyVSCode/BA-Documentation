\section{Preliminary Studies}
This chapter documents some background towards specification construct generation and the proof theory behind it. The work done in this chapter was done towards the goal of generic specification construct generation as detailed in \ref{autogen}. For reasons detailed in \ref{projectCourse} and insights won during the investigations listed in this chapter the implementation of that feature was deemed unfeasible. Nevertheless, the research lead to a deeper understanding of what is possible regarding specification construct generation and laid the basis for many other implemented features. Because the items researched in this chapter were not later implemented as is, the reading of it is not mandatory in order to understand the work ultimately done, but delivers some background on why the project took the final form it has.
