		\textbf{Behaviour at entry}\\ \hline
		
		R1 & Underestimation of workload & One or more team members can't finish a feature in time or loses to much time for a minor feature & 120 & 25\% & Weekly scrum meetings with feedback about the current work progress. Estimate workload together. Include time reserve & Help each other, if one is struggling. Feature reduction at latest. \\ 
		
		R2 & Workflow is not working & Toolchain is not working as planed. The used components aren't ideal for the problem & 30 & 15\% & Use experience to get a good setup and test it alot in the beginning & Redefine toolchain or change single tool \\ 
		
		R3 & Communication problems & Team is not working together and each member is developing individual. Creating incompatible interfaces. TODO: Rustan etc & 70 & 20\% & Weekly scrum meetings and agreements. Already worked in other projects as a team before & Increase written documentation and working closer together \\ 
		
		R4 & Lack of knowledge & Team has to less knowledge about Dafny, VSCode and the development of a VSCode Plugin & 80 & 10\% & Already experience with typescript for plugin development, as preparatory work informed about Dafny & Find necessary knowledge online, get help from Microsoft Research \\ 
		
		R5 & Data lose or manipulation & Data lose because of a server crash or to open permissions to access and modify data & 20 & 3\% & Regularly backups and restrictive permissions to change files & Use backup to restore data. Extend safety measures \\ 
		
		R6 & Failure developer machine & One of the developer machines aren't working anymore. & 10 & 1\% & Limited, regularly commits and backups. & Switch temporary to the school computer and install the necessary tools. \\
		
		R7 & Implementing the DSL is to complicated to implement or to use & The DSL would be needed to suggest possible contracts or to customize the best practice. & 100 & 30\% & This core feature has to be looked carefully that it really fits our needs and that other developer can really use the plugin. & ???? \\
		
		R8 & Supporting all features on the different environments is not possible & Due to that Windows, OSX and Linux are quite different, it could be that some features aren't possible to implement on a platform or causes a big overhead to get it running & 10 & 25\% & Using as much of the standard api as possible. Implement specific features platform dependant. & Disable a certain feature on a platform or look for a workaround. \\	
		
		R9 & Automatic installer of Dafny is not possible & Maybe of security restrictions, it could be possible that you can't download and install additional software and setting environment variables. & 35 & 20\% & Test if downloading of software can done inside VS Code. & Automatic installer can't be done inside the plugin. Switch to a different strategy and implement an automatic installer over a additional executable, which could also install the plugin in vscode. \\
